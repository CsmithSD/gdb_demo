This little application has a bug that shows up inconsistently.  If you compile
the program and run it a number of times, you will see floating point
exception error (SIGFPE).

This executable also has some memory leaks.  Make note of them and explain why
valgrind is complaining that memory is leaking.  Set a breakpoint before the
statement that causes the floating point exception.
